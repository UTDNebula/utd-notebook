If you see anything that you think could be improved, please create an issue and we will look into it.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Validation & Serialization:** Zod, SuperJSON
- **Authentication:** BetterAuth
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon), Drizzle ORM

### Getting Started

Please make sure you have at least [NodeJS v21.1.0](https://nodejs.org/en) or greater installed before continuing.

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UTDNebula/utd-notebook.git --recurse-submodules
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you already cloned the repository but don't have the `src/nebula-library` folder, run the following command:
>
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd utd-notebook
npm install
```

Make sure you have a `.env` file in the root of the project. If you do not, copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

#### Environment Variables

This project uses [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for authentication. Better Auth, with their built-in [providers](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google), makes it easy for users to use preexisting logins. Currently, we are using Discord and Google as OAuth Providers, so you will need to create a Client ID and Client Secret for [Google](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google) and [Discord](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/discord) respectively (or remove the providers if you'd like).

Once you have your Client ID and Client Secrets, add them to your `.env` file.

The `BETTER_AUTH_URL` variable should be set to `http://localhost:3000` for local development.
The `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` variable should be set to a random string of characters. You can generate one [using this website](https://randomkeygen.com/).
or by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

UTD Notebook uses an ORM called [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to interact with the database. In order to connect to the database, you will need to add the `DATABASE_URL` variable to your `.env` file. Your project lead will give this to you upon request.

The Nebula API is used for file storage. The `NEBULA_API_URL` variable should be set to `https://api.utdnebula.com/` and the `NEBULA_API_STORAGE_BUCKET` variable to `notebook`. An API key and storage key should be requested from the project lead for the `NEBULA_API_KEY` and `NEBULA_API_STORAGE_KEY` variables.

Finally, start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Branching

When working on a new feature, please create a new branch with the following naming convention:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
```

When you are ready to merge your branch into the `develop` branch, please create a pull request and request a review from the Notebook Dev Team.
Please include details about what issue you are addressing with the pull request, what changes you made, and any other relevant information.

### Nebula Library

When working in the `src/nebula-library` folder, you are working in a shared component library that is part of a nested Git repository. Follow these steps to create a secondary **pull request** (PR) for your library changes:

#### 1. Checkout a branch

```bash
cd src/nebula-library
# Replace <feature-name> with a branch name
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
```

#### 2. Make your changes in the `src/nebula-library` folder

#### 3. Push your changes

```bash
git push
cd ../..
```

#### 4. Make a pull request in the `nebula-library` repository

Make a PR from your branch into `main` at [github.com/UTDNebula/nebula-library](https://github.com/UTDNebula/nebula-library) and request your project lead as a reviewer.

Wait for your PR to be approved.

> [!TIP]
> In the meantime, you can make a regular PR on the [UTD Notebook repository](https://github.com/UTDNebula/utd-notebook). Its checks and build may not pass without your changes in `src/nebula-library`, so you can switch the branch and push with the following commands:
>
> ```bash
> # Replace <feature-name> with the feature name you used in step 1
> git submodule set-branch --branch feature/<feature-name> src/nebula-library
> git push
> ```
>
> If you do this, just make sure to run the following command before the next step:
>
> ```bash
> git submodule set-branch --default src/nebula-library
> ```

#### 5. After your `nebula-library` pull request is merged…

Pull your changes from the library and push them to Notebook. Then make a regular PR on Notebook.

```bash
git submodule update --recursive --remote
git push
```
