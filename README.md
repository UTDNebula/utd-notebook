### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Validation & Serialization:** Zod, SuperJSON
- **Authentication:** BetterAuth
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon), Drizzle ORM

### Getting Started

Please make sure you have at least [NodeJS v21.1.0](https://nodejs.org/en) or greater installed before continuing.

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UTDNebula/utd-notebook.git --recurse-submodules
```

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd utd-notebook
npm install
```

Make sure you have a `.env` file in the root of the project. If you do not, copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

#### Environment Variables

This project uses [BetterAuth](https://better-auth.com) for authentication. BetterAuth, with their built-in [providers](https://better-auth.com/docs/introduction), makes it easy for users to use preexisting logins. Currently, we are using Discord and Google as OAuth Providers, so you will need to create a Client ID and Client Secret for [Google](https://better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google) and [Discord](https://better-auth.com/docs/authentication/discord) respectively (or remove the providers if you'd like).

Once you have your Client ID and Client Secrets, add them to your `.env` file.

The `BETTER_AUTH_URL` variable should be set to `http://localhost:3000` for local development.

UTD Notebook uses an ORM called [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to interact with the database. In order to connect to the database, you will need to add the `DATABASE_URL` variable to your `.env` file. Your project lead will give this to you upon request.

The Nebula API is used for image storage. The `NEBULA_API_URL` variable should be set to `https://api.utdnebula.com/` and the `NEBULA_API_STORAGE_BUCKET` variable to `jupiter`. An API key and storage key should be requested from the project lead for the `NEBULA_API_KEY` and `NEBULA_API_STORAGE_KEY` variables.

Finally, start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Branching

When working on a new feature, please create a new branch with the following naming convention:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
```

When you are ready to merge your branch into the `develop` branch, please create a pull request and request a review from the Jupiter Dev Team.
Please include details about what issue you are addressing with the pull request, what changes you made, and any other relevant information.

#### Nebula Library

When working in the `src/nebula-library` folder you are working in a shared component library. Follow these steps to create a secondary Pull Request (PR) for your library changes.

##### 1. Checkout a Branch

```bash
cd src/nebula-library
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
```

##### 2. Make Your Changes

##### 3. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push
cd ../..
```

##### 4. Make a Pull Request

Make a PR from your branch into `main` at [github.com/UTDNebula/nebula-library](https://github.com/UTDNebula/nebula-library) and request your project lead as a reviewer.

Wait for your PR to be approved.

In the meantime you can make a normal PR for Clubs. It's checks and build may not pass without your changes in `src/nebula-library` so you can switch the branch and push with `git submodule set-branch --branch feature/<feature-name> src/nebula-library`. Just make sure to switch back to `main` in the next step.

##### 5. After Your PR is Merged

Pull your changes from the library and push them to Clubs. Then make a PR on Clubs.

```bash
git submodule update --recursive --remote
git push
```
